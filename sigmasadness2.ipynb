    "##### Usability refers to how well something is fit to be used. The program should be able to perform a number of tasks, such as Data Loading, Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Data visualization, Data reporting without any errors. The user-interface should also be easy and simple to use, with minimal effort to switch between tasks to provide a smooth user experience, and to save time. The project should also contain a READ ME document, which will inform the user on information that they should know such as instructions on how to use the program, navitagate the UI, the purpose of the program and anything else of importance. \n",
    "##### **Reliability**\n",
    "##### Reliability the degree to which the result of a measurement, calculation, or specification can be depended on to be accurate. Both the program and the user-interface should be reliable in the sense that it should be mostly free from bugs and glitches and should perform as advertised. This will ensure a better user experience and reduce the uncertainty around its outputs.\n"

    "##### The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on different countries and geographical regions. By examining how various regions faced the pandemic and the effects it had, the project aims to uncover patterns and insights that can inform public health responses, policy decisions, and future pandemic preparedness. Conducting this project is essential because the raw dataset, while comprehensive, does not provide meaningful insights on its own. The data is a collection of numbers and figures that require processing, analysis, and visualization to make sense of the underlying trends and patterns. Without a structured approach to clean, analyze, and visualize the data, it remains difficult to draw useful conclusions or actionable insights. \n",

    "###### 1. Public Health Authorities: They can use the insights to improve public health strategies and responses in the event of future pandemics.\n",
    "###### 2. Researchers: Researches can use this data to further study the effects of this pandemic and suggest new research areas\n",
    "###### 3. General Public: The general public can use this research to better inform themselves on how different geographical regions were impacted by Covid-19 and help themselves better prepare in the future."

    "#### Privacy and Security Considerations\n",
    "#### Data privacy of source:\n",
    "###### The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, which compiles publicly available information about COVID-19 cases across various countries. This data includes statistics such as case counts, recoveries, and deaths. Since the dataset is gathered at a global level, it does not contain personally identifiable information about individuals. As for the responsibilites for the data source, Kaggle and the original data providers must comply with data protection laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, which mandates the protection of individuals' privacy.\n",
    "#### Application Data privacy:\n",
    "###### As a developer working with this dataset, if I decided to push this data out to the public, it is my responsiblity to maintain user privacy and handle the data responsbily. This includes being transparent with how I use this data as well as ensuring I do not use this data in malicious ways, furthermore, this includes making sure no personally identifiable info gets revealed to the public without consent.\n",
    "#### Cyber Security:\n",
    "##### Features an application such as this one should have to maintain cybersecurity once it's online include user identification. This involves verifying the identity of users before granting access to the application or specific features within it. User identification usually includes a username and password, which are used to authenticate one's identity, or user authentication. Moreover, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) would be useful: Adding an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to a mobile device. Another crucial feature for an application to have is encryption, Encryption is the process of converting data into a coded format that can only be read by someone with the appropriate decryption key. It protects sensitive data from unauthorized access, whether the data is stored on a disk (data at rest) or being transmitted over a network (data in transit). It works by using keys to transform readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext). Only those with the correct decryption key can convert the ciphertext back into plaintext, ensuring data privacy and security. Lastly, password hashing, the process of converting a plain text password into a fixed-length string of characters, which then gets stored in a database. Hashing algorithms are one-way functions, meaning they cannot be easily reversed to reveal the original password. It works by using algorithms such as bcrypt, then, when the user logs in, their inputted password is hashed again, and the system compares it with the stored hash. If they match, the user is authenticated. Hashing ensures that even if the database is compromised, the original passwords are not easily retrievable.\n",
